3. String Manipulation - Anagram Check
I developed a Java program that takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams (having the same characters but in a different order).
  -Example:
   
   Input: "listen", "silent"  
   Output: true  

   Input: "hello", "world"  
   Output: false

4. Object-Oriented Programming - Employee Management System
I designed a Java class Employee with the following attributes:
  -id (integer)

The program:
   -Creates at least three Employee objects.
   -Stores them in a list.
   -Displays their details using the displayDetails() method.
